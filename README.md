Natural Docs Plus Package (ND+).
================================

NaturalDocs allows developers to review and share their code
comments in a browser. ActionScript, C#, and Perl developers
should consider using this documentation generator because
these languages are fully supported by NaturalDocs. Fully
supported languages come with the following features:

* Implicit comment generation
* Inheritence diagrams
* Automatic scope detection

Firstly this set of pages where generated using ND+ and shall
demonstrate many of the New Features available to Natural
Docs users with minimal changes to existing documents.

http://ndplus.sourceforge.net/

Natural Docs is an open-source documentation generator for
multiple programming languages. You document your code in a
natural syntax that reads like plain English. Natural Docs
then scans your code and builds high-quality HTML
documentation from it.

ND+ is a fork of what was Natural Docs 1.4 with a number of
enhancements hopefully under the same philosophy as Natural
Docs was originally developed.


New Features
------------

* Packages - ND++ breaks away from a one-to-one
  relationship of source pages and the produced result.
  ND++ permits packages to split across files, which
  may then be merged and/or split into a number of
  documents.
  As an example, pulling both header/include
  definitions and the underlying source code function
  definitions together into a single view.

* Tables - Several difference table formats are available.

* Prototypes - Embedded protypes.

* SyntaxHighlighter - Syntax hilighting of code snippets.

* Admonitions - Highlighted reminders and notes.

* Lists - Definition Lists, Bullet Lists and Numbered
Lists support multiple leveled definitions.

* Modelines - File level configuration options.

* Plugins - Several third party ASCII art packages have
been integrated.

* Page Footer - Global page footer.

Beta Features
-------------

* C++ - Native language support.

* Member documentation - Permits QT style member
documentation.

        SyntaxHighlighter version 3.0.83

        http://alexgorbatchev.com/SyntaxHighlighter/

    license:

        You may use any SyntaxHighlighter project under the terms of either
        the MIT License or the GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 3.

        The MIT License is recommended for most projects. It is simple and
        easy to understand and it places almost no restrictions on what you
        can do with a SyntaxHighlighter project.

        If the GPL suits your project better you are also free to use a
        SyntaxHighlighter project under that license.

        You don't have to do anything special to choose one license or the
        other and you don't have to notify anyone which license you are
        using. You are free to use a SyntaxHighlighter project in
        commercial projects as long as the copyright header is left intact.

        *ND+*, uses this package under the terms of the 'MIT License'.
